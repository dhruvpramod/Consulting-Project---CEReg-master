Hello Patrick, Smit, Maia, Dhruv and Andrew,

Here are the answers to your questions:

 

What data/knowledge is specifically of interest to be extracted from the PDFs?  What are the major points that would be of interest for reporting (i.e. in a dashboard)?

 

Bold are primary ‘must have’; the remaining ones are ‘nice to have’.

 

\textbf{1. extract quantitative data so CER can perform internally analysis;}

\textbf{2. extract data so that CER can create a construction update report for Trans Mountain pipeline and post it on CER website; (this is the dashboard component); if possible, a visualized format/dashboard/design that may work for all reports (not just Trans Mountain);}  

\textbf{3. Identify differences in methodology/terminology between reports/ between companies; provide recommendations of report format and data quality improvements;}

4. If possible, perform exploratory data analysis amongst projects; based on finding, recommends additional areas for analytical exploration;

5. Learnings on structuring PDF data and summary of python methods tried and used; ‘if you had more time, what would you do’….

 

Let me know if you have any more questions.
